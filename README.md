Elmish implements core abstractions that can be used to build applications following the [“model view update”](http://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/02-elm-arch/01-introduction.html) style of architecture, as made famous by Elm.
The library however does not model any "view" and is intended for use in conjuction with a DOM/renderer, like React/ReactNative or VirtualDOM.
Those familiar with Redux may find Elmish a more natural fit when targeting React or ReactNative as it allows one to stay completely in idiomatic F#.


Elmish abstractions have been carefully designed to resemble Elm's "look and feel" and anyone familiar with post-Signal Elm terminology will find themselves right at home.

See the [docs site](https://fable-elmish.github.io/elmish/) for more information.


Using Elmish
------
v0.9 and above releases of Elmish target Fable 1.x and use `dotnet` SDK and can be installed with `paket`:

`paket add nuget Fable.Elmish -i`

For v0.8 release information please see the [v0.8.x branch](https://github.com/fable-elmish/elmish/tree/v0.8.x)


Building Elmish
------
As part of Fable 1.x ecosystem, elmish depends on [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).
Unless the SDK is installed and is in the path the build will download and install it locally:

Just run fake:
> `./build.sh` or `build`
